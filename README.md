Growth mindset to me is basically expanding
 your mind to grow.Meaning doing what you have to do to learn and  get your brain growing to accomplish what you want to do in life.
3 reminders to self of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset 1. acknowledge that if you do something wrong or dont get it right the first time that its ok. 2. always have a sense of purpose. 3. When you are struggling dont fault yourself tell yourself you are learning.
